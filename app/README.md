Additionally, authors can choose to delete their posts through a simple, yet secure process Our implementation focuses on giving authors flexibility and autonomy over their posts while maintaining a straightforward and intuitive interface for these critical content management functions.
* **Search**
  * Grade: 6
  * Comments: We developed a sophisticated server-side search functionality to facilitate efficient and effective content discovery on our platform. This feature allows users to search for posts by keywords, enhancing the overall user experience and accessibility of content. The search is implemented using Supabase's Full Text Search capabilities, ensuring fast and relevant results. We placed a search bar in a prominent location on the website, making it easy for users to access this feature. When a user enters a search term, the query is processed on the server-side, and matching posts are returned and displayed in an organized manner. This feature not only improves navigation but also helps users quickly find the content of interest, significantly enhancing the usability of our blogging platform. Our focus was on creating a responsive and accurate search system that aligns with the needs of our users for quick information retrieval.

This feature is implemented in the footer of our application, where each visit or page refresh fetches a new random cat image from the API. This integration not only adds an element of fun and surprise to the user experience but also demonstrates our ability to incorporate third-party services into our platform. The random cat images serve as a delightful visual treat for our users and showcase our commitment to creating an engaging and interactive platform.
* **Resource access control**
  * Grade: 6
  * Comments: We implemented robust resource access control by leveraging Supabase's Row-Level Security (RLS) features. Our focus was on ensuring the security and integrity of user data and content within our application. We established strict policies to regulate access to different resources: 
    - Only authenticated users are allowed to create posts. This policy is enforced through a custom RLS policy on our 'posts' table, ensuring that unauthenticated users cannot add content to the platform.
    - Additionally, we implemented a policy that allows users to only modify or delete their own posts. This is achieved by checking the 'user_id' associated with each post against the current authenticated user's ID, ensuring that users cannot alter or remove content that they do not own.
  These measures effectively prevent unauthorized access and modifications, ensuring a secure environment for our users to engage with the platform. The implementation of these policies not only safeguards user data but also aligns with best practices in application security and data privacy.

## Miscellaneous

### Course Feedback

Throughout this course, we greatly appreciated the hands-on approach to learning full-stack web development. The curriculum's focus on modern web technologies, including Next.js, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS, provided us with practical skills and insights directly applicable to current industry standards.

One of the course's strengths was its practical orientation, which allowed us to apply theoretical concepts in a real-world project setting. This experience has been invaluable in understanding the intricacies of building and deploying a full-scale web application.

However, we observed a gap in the curriculum regarding advanced React patterns and state management techniques. While the course laid a solid foundation in React fundamentals, additional content on complex React concepts, state management libraries (like Redux or Context API), and best practices in larger-scale applications would have been highly beneficial.

Overall, the course provided an excellent learning experience.
